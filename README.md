# Axplorer
All code in this repo is available under the MIT License unless specified otherwise. All code is available as-is. Axolittles takes no risk or responsibility for anyone using this code.

The Axplorer is built on the Svelte framework, which is a fast component-driven framework similar to React.
The transaction history, wallet lookups, and data pages are all powered by a bespoke backend written in NodeJS with MongoDB.
The frontend uses Bulma for its customisability and ease of use.
The Staking and Bridging pages use a custom backend API using TheGraph.
The website is hosted on Vercel, domains managed by CloudFlare, and the images are pulled from the AxolittlesCDN.
